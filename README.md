Objective

The objective of this assignment is to implement a simple encryption and decryption program in any programing language.

Program Features

(1) Encryption:
• Prompt the user to enter plaintext and a key.
• Use the entered key to perform encryption (e.g., Shift cipher).
• Display the resulting ciphertext.

(2) Decryption:
• Prompt the user to enter ciphertext and the corresponding key used for encryption.
• Use the entered key to perform decryption and retrieve the original plaintext.
• Display the decrypted plaintext.

(3) Brute Force Attack:
• Prompt the user to enter only the ciphertext (without the key).
• Implement a brute force attack to try all possible keys (shift values) for a Caesar cipher.
• Display all the possible plaintext results.
User Interaction
The program should display a menu with options for encryption, decryption, and brute force attack. The
user can choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding option number.
